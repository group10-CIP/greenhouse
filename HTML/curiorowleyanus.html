		<h1>STRINGS OF PEARLS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/curio_rowleyanus.png" class="featured">
		<p>Curio rowleyanus, is a flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. It is a creeping, perennial, succulent vine native to the drier parts of southwest Africa. In its natural environment its stems trail on the ground, rooting where they touch and forming dense mats. It often avoids direct sunlight by growing in the shade of other plants and rocks. It is commonly known as string-of-pearls or string-of-beads.
        "String-of-beads" and several other common names are shared with Curio herreanus (string of watermelons), which has teardrop-shaped leaves, rather than spherical. Curio rowleyanus receives its common name from specialized leaves which are the size and shape of small peas (about 1⁄4 inch diameter).Its trailing stems can grow 2–3 feet (60–90 cm). There is a small tip at the distal point of each leaf and a thin band of dark green tissue on the side known as a "window" (see below). It blooms during the summer and, like all asterids, it has a compound flower. The trumpet shaped flower forms clusters (about 1⁄2 inch diameter) of small white flowers with colorful stamens. The flower will last about a month and is said to smell like cinnamon and other spices.</p>

		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>String of pearls plants thrive on a combination of direct and indirect sunlight, totaling between six and eight hours a day. They're best kept in direct sunlight during the softer morning hours, then moved to a spot that gets diffused, indirect light, or partial shade throughout the harsher afternoon hours.</p>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>Keep the plant's soil lightly moist during the growing season in the spring and summer, then reduce water during the winter months. If you notice the succulent's spherical leaves are flattening out, that's a good indication that the plant needs more water. Be careful not to overwater your string of pearls plant—succulents are drought-resistant but cannot survive with wet, soggy roots.</p>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>String of pearls plants thrive in warm temperatures above 70 degrees Fahrenheit from spring through fall. It grows best with cooler winter temperatures, ranging from 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Low humidity is also preferred for the plant, so avoid placing it in any already-humid areas of your home, like a kitchen or bathroom.</p>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>Any regular succulent potting soil is fine for your string of pearls plants, but sandy soil is best. A good choice for this plant is a cactus potting mix—alternatively, you can use a 3:1 mixture of potting soil and sharp sand. These plants are It is susceptible to root rot, so it's important to make sure their soil is well-draining. Plant them in a container that boasts ample drainage holes at its base—one made of terra cotta or clay can also help wick away excess moisture from the soil.</p>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Feed your string of pearls plants biweekly during their growing season with a balanced liquid or water-soluble fertilizer, diluted to about half strength. During its winter dormant period, you'll only need to feed the plant every six weeks or so.</p>
