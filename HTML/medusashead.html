		<h1>Head of Medusa</h1>
		<img src="../Media/medusashead.png" class="featured">
		<p>Tillandsia caput-medusae is also referenced as the head of Medusa due to its distinct shape. It grows without a substrate and its snake-shaped leaves bring an exotic flair to living rooms. The head of Medusa is an easy-care indoor plant, as long as you pay attention to its unorthodox needs. Provided proper care, this tillandsia does not even challenge an inexpert hand. These care instructions explain how to tie up this glamorous bromeliad in a perfect location, make it flower, water properly, fertilize, overwinter and propagate it. It produces red or blue flowers in early summer.</p>
	
	<br>	
	<h2>Light</h2>
	<p>Filtered sunlight works best for the Tillandsia caput-medusae. Too much intense, direct afternoon sun can cause the foliage to burn and turn brown. It's a fine balance, though, as not enough sun can mean growth is slow, and the plant might not bloom.</p>

	<br>
	<h2>Water</h2>
	<p>Under and overwatering are common problems with Tillandsia species. Too little and the foliage can become dry, curled and brown. Too much and root rot can kill off the plant. If the leaves start to curl upwards excessively, this could be a sign the plant is dehydrated. Some enthusiasts recommended submerging the plant for around 12 hours to combat this problem. Mist the plant for 2 or 4 times a week.</p>	
	
	<br>
	<h2>Temperature</h2>
	<p>The cold conditions can even stimulate better flowering. These plants usually don't have a problem surviving in temperatures as low as 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and can even cope with short periods of frost. It can withstand near freezing temperatures, but most will thrive between 70 F and 85 F. High humidity is a bonus.</p>
		
	<br>
	<h2>Soil</h2>
	<p>It can grow in very well-drained, leafy soils outdoors if the temperatures are right. However, they are more successfully and commonly grown as indoor air plants or kept in containers using a potting medium designed for Bromeliad species. Or they can be on driftwoods, cork, or corals stones.</p>
		
	<br>
	<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
	<p>Tillandsia caput-medusae isn't always necessary, there are soluble fertilizers that have been developed especially for air plant species. Using them can encourage blooming. These solutions can be mixed into a water spray and applied a couple of times during the growing season. Be careful not to over-fertilize though, as this can scorch the plant.</p>
