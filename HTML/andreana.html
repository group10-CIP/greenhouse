		<h1>ANDREANA</h1>
		<img src="../Media/andreana.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Tillandsia andreana, the Tillandsia andreana has wispy bright green leaves and a round rosette shape. A rare plant, that will grow into quite an impressive clump over time. It is unique looking air plant which originates from Colombia. The andreana air plants have compact bases and delicate, thin leaves that extend in all directions. The andreana air plant is rare in cultivation and a wonderful addition for indoors especially terrariums. </p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
	<p>Filtered sunlight works best for the Tillandsia andreana. Too much intense, direct afternoon sun can cause the foliage to burn and turn brown. It's a fine balance, though, as not enough sun can mean growth is slow, and the plant might not bloom.</p>
		
		<br>
	<h2>Water</h2>
	<p>Under and overwatering are common problems with Tillandsia species. Too little and the foliage can become dry, curled and brown. Too much and root rot can kill off the plant. If the leaves start to curl upwards excessively, this could be a sign the plant is dehydrated. Some enthusiasts recommended submerging the plant for around 12 hours to combat this problem.</p>	
	
		<br>
	<h2>Temperature</h2>
	<p>The cold conditions can even stimulate better flowering. These plants usually don't have a problem surviving in temperatures as low as 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and can even cope with short periods of frost.</p>
		
		<br>
	<h2>Soil</h2>
	<p>It can grow in very well-drained, leafy soils outdoors if the temperatures are right. However, they are more successfully and commonly grown as indoor air plants or kept in containers using a potting medium designed for Bromeliad species.</p>
		
		<br>
	<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
	<p>Tillandsia andreana isn't always necessary, there are soluble fertilizers that have been developed especially for air plant species. Using them can encourage blooming. These solutions can be mixed into a water spray and applied a couple of times during the growing season. Be careful not to over-fertilize though, as this can scorch the plant.</p>
