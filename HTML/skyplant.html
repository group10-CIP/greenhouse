		<h1>SKY PLANT</h1>
		<img src="../Media/skyplant.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Tillandsia ionantha, also known as the sky plant, is a bromeliad plant. It is a small evergreen epiphyte with compact rosettes of green and silver-hued leaves. When the plant becomes older, its color turns into a deeper shade of green. The leaves also turn into a deep red when it is in its flowering stage. It has a violet petals for its flower. Sky plants often bloom bright flowers toward the end of their life. It can grow upto 5 inches and adds up another inch when it is flowering. When taking care of this plant, it needs a adequate amount of moist and warm place.</p>
		
	<h2>Light</h2>
	<p>If you put them somewhere with strong, full sun throughout the day, they can become overly dry, and the leaves can scorch, especially if humidity levels are low. They're a great addition in office environments because of their love of fluorescent lighting. If the lighting isn't bright enough, however, they're unlikely to flower.</p>
		
	<h2>Water</h2>
	<p>Air plants like Tillandsia ionantha thrive when the conditions are warm and humid. They don't need as much water as many air plants, though, and don't appreciate being soaking wet. This is why light misting is what is recommended. Usually, this will be around a few times a week, or more if you live in a hot and dry climate. Mist the plant for 2 or 4 times a week. Trapped water in the leaves is a big problem for this plant, and over-watering is one the main reason why people end up killing them off.</p>	
	
	<h2>Temperature</h2>
	<p>Although Tillandsia ionantha is a mesic variety suited to warm, humid, tropical-like environments (ideally between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit), provided you give them regular mistings, they can still do well in dry heat. Cooler temperatures in the winter are appreciated, and this will help to encourage flowering the next year. Good air circulation is also vital for this plant.</p>
		
	<h2>Soil</h2>
	<p>If you're placing your Tillandsia ionantha in a hanging position, you may initially need to use a safe glue or wire to secure it. After around a month, the plant's roots should start to wrap onto the mount, wood, or other plants. Or they can be on driftwoods, cork, or corals stones.</p>
		
	<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
	<p>Some fertilizers are made specifically for air plants, and feeding your Tillandsia ionantha with one anywhere from once a fortnight to once a month could be beneficial during the summer months.</p>
