		<h1>BROMELIADS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/bromeliads.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Bromeliads are probably the easiest of all tropical plants to grow. These tropical epiphytes (air plants) are easily adapted to growing in pots, and they are much more tolerant than many of their lush-leaved 
		colleagues. They come in a wide array of colors and textures. Bromeliads can be grown in fast-draining potting soil consisting of peat-based soil and sand. Bromeliads can also be grown mounted to boards or logs 
		and hung on the wall. The term "bromeliad" refers to thousands of species of plants in hundreds of genera in the plant family Bromeliaceae. Even when narrowed to those common species and cultivars grown as 
		houseplants, both types are usually grown in a porous, well-draining potting mixture. As a general rule of thumb, bromeliads will thrive in the same conditions as epiphytic orchids. However, they are considerably 
		more tolerant than orchids of fluctuations in temperature, drought, and careless feeding. Bromeliads are relatively slow-growing plants that take one to three years to mature into flowering plants.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Different genera of bromeliads are tolerant of different levels of light. Some can withstand full tropical sun, while others will quickly scorch. In general, the varieties with soft, flexible, spineless leaves 
		usually prefer lower light levels, while those with stiff, hard leaves prefer bright indirect light. Plants that are yellowish might be receiving too much light, while plants that are dark green or elongated might 
		be receiving too little light. Increasing light exposure can help the plant bloom, provided the other conditions are appropriate.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>Bromeliads are very tolerant of drought conditions. In a typical house, it's usually not necessary to keep the central cup of the plant constantly filled with water. But this is an option if the light levels 
		and temperature are high. If you do centrally water your bromeliad, make sure to flush the central cup every so often to remove any built-up salts. But in general, it's enough to water these plants very sparingly 
		through the soil weekly during the growing season and reduce watering during the winter rest period. Never let the plant rest in standing water. Plants you are growing as epiphytes (as air plants without soil) 
		need more consistent watering; drench them once a day, and give them a good soaking by submerging them in water once per week.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>Bromeliads are also highly tolerant of temperature variations, but plants in hotter conditions need more humidity. Bromeliads prefer temperatures between 55 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Though some cold-hardy 
		types can survive temperatures down to 20 degrees, they should generally not be exposed to temperatures under 40 degrees. They grow well indoors at humidity levels between 40 and 60 percent. In many climates, 
		bromeliads can be moved outdoors during the summer.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>Bromeliads frown indoors thrive in fast-draining potting soil that holds moisture but drains well. A mixture of 2/3 peat-based soil and 1/3 sand is often ideal. You can also use orchid mix, charcoal, or soilless 
		potting mix. Many bromeliads that are epiphytic can be grown in containers, or you can try to grow them as authentic "air plants" mounted to boards or logs (typically secured with ties or glue).</p>
		
		
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Bromeliads are not heavy feeders. During the growing season, use a liquid fertilizer diluted at 1/8 or 1/4 strength, applied every two to four weeks. If you use a slow-release pellet fertilizer, apply a single 
		pellet once each season when watering the central cup. Avoid feeding mature plants in winter or when the plant begins to flower.</p>
