		<h1>DUMB CANE</h1>
		<img src="../Media/dumbcane.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Dumb cane is ubiquitous as a houseplant, so it is easy to forget it is also a true tropical foliage plant. To grow this popular plant, use a fast-draining potting mix and fertilize with a 20-20-20 mix. Locate 
		it in a warm (over 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and draft-free location. The Dieffenbachia genus includes a large group of beautiful tropical perennials, but the ones most commonly grown in cultivation are D. sequine, 
		D. oerstedii, D. maculata, and D. amoena. Several Dieffenbachia species have recently been reassigned with different names, so you may run into confusion on the precise naming of different varieties. Collectively, 
		they are generally known as dieffenbachias or dumbcanes. The name "dumbcane" originated because chewing the plant can cause swelling of the tongue and difficulty speaking. Dieffenbachiasâ€‹ feature pointed, ovate 
		leaves in a variety of combinations of green, cream, and white colors. A large, well-grown dieffenbachia can reach 10 feet, with leaves 20 inches long. However, the plants will rarely reach this size in typical 
		indoor conditions, where 3 to 5 feet is more common. Dieffenbachia is a fast-growing plant that can achieve 2 feet in height within a year of planting a rooted cutting, provided it gets enough light.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Dieffenbachia plants are popular indoor plants largely because they do well in shady conditions, but these plants do appreciate bright light during the winter months. During the growing season, the plant prefers 
		dappled shade or indirect light. The plant will favor the side facing the light, so periodically rotate the plant to keep its growth balanced.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>During the growing season, dieffenbachias like regular moisture and do not want to dry out. A large dieffenbachia might need to be watered twice a week, but in the winter, cut back on the water. At the same time, 
		it's important not to overwater a dieffenbachia, which can cause rot problems. Make sure the top of the soil is fully dried out before watering.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>This plant likes fairly warm conditions, from 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature drops below 60 degrees Fahrenheit or if the plant is exposed to cold drafts, it is likely to lose lower leaves and assume 
		a palm-like appearance.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>Use a fast-draining, well-aerated potting mix. Make sure drainage is good to avoid damaging the roots; they should never be left in soggy soil.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>For best results, feed regularly (every 4 to 6 weeks) with a balanced, diluted fertilizer, such as a 20-20-20. However, some growers swear by a routine of using a weak diluted fertilizer at every watering.</p>
