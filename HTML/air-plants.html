		<h1>AIR PLANTS</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Tillandsias, or commonly called Air Plants, are plants that can be planted without soil and hanging around. They are good as indoor ornamental plants because of their small size and almost no visible roots. They can be planted through many different places such as driftwood, old picture frames, pots, or just even rocks. These plants are part of the Bromeliaceae or Bromeliad species. They are epiphytes that means they are not as much dependent to water unlike the other traditional plants. They can survive with just miniscule amount of water and what they need most are the light and air circulation. These plants can also bud flowers when they are old enough to do so. When they are found in the wild, they can be found attached to other plants like trees and shrubs. The air plants origins came from areas with warm climates on the American Continent. They can also be considered as tropical plants.</p>
