		<h1>Pink Quill Plant</h1>
		<img src="../Media/pinkquill.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>The Tillandsia cyanea, which is more commonly known as the pink quill, is an easy-to-care-for, versatile, and robust tropical houseplant. Part of the Bromeliad family, unlike most Tillandsia species, it can be grown in a pot as well as an air plant. It produces a display of large, long-lasting, showy pink bracts that resemble ink quills, and this is where the inspiration for its common name comes from. The bracts add interest for several monthsâ€”so you'll have plenty opportunity to enjoy their vibrancy. You'll also get to appreciate the pretty little violet flowers that emerge in the summer; although they only last two or three days. It usually takes a couple of years for a plant to reach maturity, and it won't bloom until then. In their native tropical rainforest environment, the Tillandsia cyanea grows as an epiphytic species on trees. Having the option to grow it in a pot rather than securing the pink quill to other objects (like wood) or attaching with wires, makes it particularly appealing for some houseplant lovers.</p>
		
	<h2>Light</h2>
	<p>Filtered sunlight works best for the Tillandsia cyanea. Too much intense, direct afternoon sun can cause the foliage to burn and turn brown. It's a fine balance, though, as not enough sun can mean growth is slow, and the plant might not bloom.</p>
		
	<h2>Water</h2>
	<p>Under and overwatering are common problems with Tillandsia species. Too little and the foliage can become dry, curled and brown. Too much and root rot can kill off the plant. If the leaves start to curl upwards excessively, this could be a sign the plant is dehydrated. Some enthusiasts recommended submerging the plant for around 12 hours to combat this problem. Mist the plant for 2 or 4 times a week.</p>	
	
	<h2>Temperature</h2>
	<p>The cold conditions can even stimulate better flowering. These plants usually don't have a problem surviving in temperatures as low as 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and can even cope with short periods of frost. It can withstand near freezing temperatures, but most will thrive between 70 F and 85 F. High humidity is a bonus.</p>
		
	<h2>Soil</h2>
	<p>It can grow in very well-drained, leafy soils outdoors if the temperatures are right. However, they are more successfully and commonly grown as indoor air plants or kept in containers using a potting medium designed for Bromeliad species. Or they can be on driftwoods, cork, or corals stones.</p>
		
	<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
	<p>Tillandsia cyanea isn't always necessary, there are soluble fertilizers that have been developed especially for air plant species. Using them can encourage blooming. These solutions can be mixed into a water spray and applied a couple of times during the growing season. Be careful not to over-fertilize though, as this can scorch the plant.</p>
