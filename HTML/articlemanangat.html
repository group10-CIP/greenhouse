		<h1>How Are Indoor Plants Beneficial To Us?</h1>
		<img src="../Media/articlerenz.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Aside from being pleasant decorations to your household, indoor plants have other, more
		beneficial purposes that may convince you to start having them with you in your humble abode.
		Such benefits ranges from having a pretty sight to actual health benefits.</p>

		<p>It is already a well-known fact that plants converts the carbon dioxide that we emit back
		to oxygen that we can absorb into our body. However, since residential areas tend to have quite
		a distance from the nearest plants, it takes quite a while for this interaction to happen efficiently,
		not to mention the amount of pollution it picks up along the way leaves us with polluted oxygen to 
		take in. Having plants in our immediate vicinity may help with that problem since we no longer have
		to be worried of polluted air. Additionally, not only do they provide us with clean oxygen, they also
		clean our air polluted with chemical remains from our household items. They purify this toxins, leaving
		us with close to perfect sanitary air to breathe in. Such toxins include Formaldehyde, commonly found
		in tissues, wood products, and synthetic fabrics. There is also Trichloroethylene found in paint,
		varnishes, and household cleaners, Benzene found in adhesives, lubricants, and detergents. There are 
		more of these toxins found in our homes but with the aid of indoor plants, they can atleast be reduced
		to the point of ineffectiveness.</p>
		
		<p>Indoor plants are not just simple decorations. With the right plants, we can create an environment
		within our homes that naturally cleanse toxic leftovers from household items, and at the same time,
		provide us with a visually healing sight. It may help us in destressing ourselves with its naturally
		calming color. WIth these facts, maybe you might find yourself looking for beautiful plants to accompany
		you at home.</p>
