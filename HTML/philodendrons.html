		<h1>PHILODENDRONS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/philodendrons.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>For indoor use, there are climbing varieties and the self-heading (non-climbing) types of philodendrons. Newer hybrids have been bred that mix the vigor and ease of the climbing varieties with the convenience 
		of the self-heading varieties. It is easier than ever to grow them. The Philodendron genus contains hundreds of species of beautiful foliage plants. And many are commonly grown as houseplants. In fact, they’re often 
		touted for their air-cleaning abilities indoors. Their leaves are typically large, green, and glossy, adding a touch of their native tropical jungles to your home. There are two basic types of philodendrons: the 
		vining plants and the non-climbing plants. The vining plants grow vines of several feet and need some sort of support structure to climb on, such as a trellis or around a basket. The non-climbing types have an 
		upright growth habit and make for excellent foliage plants in containers. In general, philodendrons have a fast growth rate. They’re best planted in the spring, but houseplants typically can be started at any time 
		of year with success.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Philodendrons typically grow best in partial sunlight. They naturally would get dappled light under a tropical canopy, not direct sun. Indoors, set them up by a window that gets bright, indirect light. Too little 
		light can result in leggy growth with lots of space in between the leaves. But too much light can cause many of the leaves to turn yellow at the same time. (Only a few leaves yellowing is typically just normal aging.)</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>These plants generally like a moderate amount of soil moisture. Water whenever the top inch of soil has dried out. Both overwatering and underwatering can cause the leaves to droop, so gauge when it’s time to water 
		by the soil dryness and not necessarily the leaves. Philodendrons don’t do well sitting in soggy soil, as this can lead to root rot. The non-climbing varieties tend to have a little more drought tolerance than the 
		vining species.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>The temperature tolerance of philodendrons varies based on the species. In general, they should not be exposed to temperatures below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoors, protect them from cool drafts, such as those from 
		an air-conditioning vent. These plants do like humidity, so if you live in a dry climate you might have to boost humidity around your philodendron. To do so, you can mist the plant every few days with water from a spray 
		bottle. You also can place the container on a tray of pebbles filled with water, ensuring that the bottom of the container isn't touching the water, which can lead to root rot.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>Philodendrons like a loose potting soil that’s rich in organic matter. The soil must have good drainage. For container plants, it’s recommended to replace your philodendron’s soil every couple of years or so. 
		These plants are sensitive to salts that accumulate in the soil via watering, which can cause leaf browning and yellowing. You can periodically flush out some of the salts by watering your container thoroughly until 
		water comes out of its drainage holes. But eventually the soil will need refreshing.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Use a balanced liquid fertilizer monthly on your plant in the spring and summer. Then, reduce feeding to every six to eight weeks in the fall and winter. If your plant isn’t getting enough food, its growth will be 
		slower than normal and its leaves might appear smaller than usual.</p>
