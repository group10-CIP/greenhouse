		<h1>JADE PLANT</h1>
		<img src="../Media/crassula_ovata.png" class="featured">
		<p>Crassula ovata, commonly known as jade plant, lucky plant, money plant or money tree, is a succulent plant with small pink or white flowers that is native to the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, and Mozambique; it is common as a houseplant worldwide. Much of its popularity stems from the low levels of care needed; the jade plant requires little water and can survive in most indoor conditions. It is sometimes referred to as the money tree. The jade plant is an evergreen with thick branches. It has thick, shiny, smooth leaves that grow in opposing pairs along the branches. Leaves are a rich jade green, although some may appear to be more of a yellow-green. Some varieties may develop a red tinge on the edges of leaves when exposed to high levels of sunlight. New stem growth is the same colour and texture as the leaves, becoming woody and brown with age. It grows as an upright, rounded, thick-stemmed, strongly branched shrub and reaches stature heights of up to 2.5 metres. The base is usually sparsely branched. Sometimes a single main trunk of up to 6 centimetres in diameter is formed. The succulent shoots are gray-green. The bark of older branches peels off in horizontal, brownish stripes. Although becoming brown and appearing woody with age, stems never become true lignified tissue, remaining succulent and fleshy throughout the plant's life. The oppositely arranged, ascending to spreading, green leaves are stalked with up to 5 millimetres short. The fleshy, bare, obovate, wedge-shaped leaf blade is 3 to 9 centimetres long and 1.8 to 4 centimetres wide. The sharp-edged leaf margins are often reddish.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Jade plants love light, and young plants especially should be exposed to bright, indirect sun in order to thrive. Jade plants young and old should receive at least four to six hours of sunlight daily, but keep the plant safe from direct rays of sunlight. Harsh light can scorch young, immature plants or cause the leaves on older ones to turn red.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>During the summer and spring, jade plants should be watered often so that their soil is moist but not wet, making sure drainage is immaculate. Reduce your watering to monthly in the winter. If you water from beneath by letting the plant sit in a saucer of water, pour off any excess water after a few minutesâ€”never let your jade plant sit in water.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>Jade plants prefer average temperatures of 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. At night and in the winter, jade plants can handle a cooler environment, down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep in mind, jade plants are not frost tolerant, so if they're kept outside, bring them in when the temperature dips to 50 degrees Fahrenheit or below.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>When choosing a mixture to house your jade plant in, a succulent-specific blend is your best bet. Ideally, the soil should have a neutral to slightly acidic pH level, and drain well in order to prevent excessive moisture from accumulating and leading to fungal growth. If you end up using an all-purpose potting mix instead, add some perlite to help assist with drainage. Additionally, you can house your jade plant in a terracotta or clay vessel to help wick extra moisture from the soil.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Many people underfeed their succulents during their growing season. For the most successful jade plant, feed it with a controlled-release fertilizer at the beginning of the season or weekly with a weak liquid solution. Use a balanced 20-20-20 fertilizer at one-quarter strength on mature plants, and a fertilizer with less nitrogen on young plants.</p>
