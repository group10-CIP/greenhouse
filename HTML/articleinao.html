		<h1>8 Things First-Time Plant Owners Should Know</h1>
		<p class="author">by: Kenneth Aedrianne M. Inao</p>
		<img src="../Media/articleinao.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Let’s start off by pouring one out for the houseplants we’ve lost along the way. It’s a tragic tale many of us know well: 
		You adopt a spritely new plant baby, whisking it away from your local farmers market to give it the loving home it deserves. 
		Once you’ve got it all settled into the sunniest corner of your room, you step back and take in the magic, bathing in the 
		Insta-worthy lushness it brings to your space. Everything seems fine and dandy, until one day, it doesn’t. All of a sudden, 
		the leaves aren’t as green as they once were, and the stems have begun to droop. You followed its former owner’s instructions 
		to a T, but to no avail—your fiddle-leaf friend is a withered shell of what it once was.</p>

		<p>Like all things in life, nurturing plants takes practice, and what better time than now to master your green thumb? We spoke 
		to Eliza Blank, founder of The Sill, and Bloomcape’s resident plant mom, Joyce, to find out the leading cause of accidental plant 
		death and the most effective ways to avoid it from happening again. “Not only do indoor plants enhance the overall appearance of 
		pretty much any space, but studies have shown indoor plants can boost moods and reduce stress, increase creativity and productivity, 
		and eliminate air pollutants,” says Eliza. ”All making for a healthier, happier you.” So, in pursuit of a healthy plant family and 
		an uplifted abode, read expert plant tips every first-time owner should know—from how to pot, to learning to just leave your plant 
		alone. (Helicopter plant parents, we’re talking to you.)</p>
		
		<br><h2>Understand the light in your space.</h2>
		<p>The first step to helping your plants thrive is to consider the light quality in your space. You can’t expect a bird-of-paradise 
		to bloom without direct sunlight, and too-bright light will scorch your peace lily to its demise. So start by analyzing the capacity 
		of your environment and choosing a plant that will thrive in it. “If you’re not sure what type of light you have just by looking–start 
		by figuring out what direction your windows face, then check if there’s anything right outside that’s blocking natural sunlight that 
		could stream in. Keep it simple and decide, is the light direct or indirect? Then, if indirect, is it bright, medium, or low? Once you 
		narrow it down, it’ll be much easier to choose the best plant varieties for your space,” explains Eliza. If sunlight is limited in your 
		space, consider the low-maintenance plants below.</p>
		
		<br><h2>Get a planter with a drainage hole.</h2>
		<p>Sure, an aesthetically pleasing home will motivate you to keep it alive and well, but a sturdy planter is key to keeping your plant 
		baby happy. “I’m an advocate for a great planter you love,” says Eliza. “Even if you’re going to simply drop the grow pot in, a good 
		planter tells you, ‘This plant is here to stay.’ It gives you that little extra boost to care for your new plant. Or in the unfortunate 
		event it doesn’t work out, it gives you a beautiful empty vessel worth filling and a reason to try again.” When choosing a planter, make 
		sure it has a drainage hole. Drainage holes discourage root rot and give excess water a way to escape, preventing your plant from drowning. 
		We’ll never let go, Jack.</p>
		
		<br><h2>Don’t overwater.</h2>
		<p>Both experts noted overwatering as one of the most common mistakes that leads to an unhappy plant. “Nine times out of 10, it’s better 
		to underwater than to overwater,” Eliza explains. “Overwatering is one of the easiest ways to kill a houseplant. You may be tempted to water 
		your plants on a strict schedule, but the best bet is to only water when needed. Always check the soil before watering. If it’s still moist, 
		wait to water.” One telltale sign of an overwatered plant is yellowing leaves. If you think your plant might be overwatered, follow the 
		experts' steps below.</p>
		<p>1. Gently tip the potted plant on its side so it’s almost upside down over your sink. Any water not yet absorbed by the soil can then 
		trickle out.<br>
		2. Relocate your plant to a spot that receives bright light, which can help the potting mix dry out quicker. If the potting mix is more 
		water than soil, you might have better luck repotting your plant entirely into a new dry mix.<br>
		3. Let the plant “tell” you when it needs water. There is so much variance within an indoor environment that it is difficult to schedule 
		watering; it depends on the indoor temperatures, humidity, where the plant resides, etc.</p>
		
		<br><h2>Don’t be afraid to repot.</h2>
		<p>You may have seen plant owners on Instagram repotting their plants lately, because spring is the ideal time to do so. If your plants could
		use a pick-me-up, give them new soil and a slightly bigger home. “Before the summer growing season is the best time to repot your houseplants.
		Repotting does not always mean moving your plant into a bigger planter–sometimes it simply means changing your plant’s potting mix to provide 
		it with fresh nutrients. However, if your plant has overgrown its current planter, choose a new pot that’s only slightly larger in size. 
		Upsizing should be a gradual process throughout the years. You do not want your plant swimming in potting mix, which can lend itself to 
		overwatering, and potentially root rot,” explains Eliza.</p>
		
		<br><h2>Keep the temperature stable.</h2>
		<p>The next time you wonder whether you lost a few marbles while talking to your plant, stop to remember we’re actually quite similar to our 
		green friends. “Just like us, houseplants are often most comfortable between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit,” says Eliza. “Extreme cold or hot 
		fluctuations in temperature can stress them out. Do your best to avoid placing plants near temperature hazards like vents, radiators, and 
		exterior doors or open windows, which might create hot or cold drafts of air.”</p>
		
		<br><h2>Don’t be a helicopter parent.</h2>
		<p>Even if you pretty much consider plants to be members of the family, be careful not to smother them. Just like kids who are bound to 
		scrape their knee a few times (and are perfectly fine), plants are more resilient than meets the eye. “It might sound silly, but less is more
		when it comes to care for most houseplants,” Eliza explains. “Plants are hardier than we think—they can tolerate a bit of neglect. Some might 
		even appreciate it. Specifically during long winter months when most indoor tropical plants are dormant, you’ll want to water less, and 
		expect them to lose a few leaves. This natural, seasonal shedding process happens when plants don’t get enough sunlight to support their 
		current leaves.”</p>
		
		<br><h2>Remove dead leaves.</h2>
		<p>Don’t let discolored leaves get you down. If you notice a plant is beginning to yellow, remove the damaged area of the leaf, or the 
		complete leaf if it’s entirely brown. The removal of the affected area will make space for new life. “Remove the yellow or brown crispy 
		leaves (they will not turn green again) with a pair of sharp scissors or pruning shears,” says Joyce. “Be sure to wipe the blades with 
		rubbing alcohol between each snip. You may need to remove leaves in stages because you never want to remove more than 30% of the affected 
		leaves at one time.” Unlike with your overgrown fringe, you should feel confident going forward with a little snip-snip for your plant at 
		home.</p>
		
		<br><h2>Don’t under-water.</h2>
		<p>Despite the risk of overwatering, water is obviously vital for your plant to thrive. Monitor your plant’s soil to best know when it’s 
		thirsty. “If you see your plant is wilting and has crispy brown leaf edges, check to see if the soil is dry. Stick your finger two or three 
		inches into the soil. If it’s dry, fill a sink with two to four inches of lukewarm water. Remove the planter from its saucer and place it 
		into the sink, then allow the plant to soak up the water from the bottom. Give the process 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the size of the 
		pot; the larger the pot, the longer it should sit in the water. At this time it is also a good idea to take the sprayer and give the leaves 
		a little shower. This will help hydrate the plant quickly and remove any dust from the foliage,” says Eliza. In addition to a good watering 
		can, Joyce suggests adding a good mister to your arsenal. “I recommend a mister, as plants like humidity. I like to mist my plants and careful
		ly examine the foliage to make sure there aren’t any little bugs and keep them dust-free, especially in the winter,” says Joyce.</p>
