		<h1>ZEBRA CACTUS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/fasciated_haworthia.png" class="featured">
		<p>Haworthiopsis fasciata, formerly known as Haworthia fasciata, is a small succulent that forms rosettes of green, triangular leaves lined with white bumps on the underside. It offsets readily to form clumps. The rosettes can grow up to 7.2 inches (18 cm) tall and up to 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. Flowers are white, tubular, and appear in summer at the end of an up to 1 foot (30 cm) long inforescence. This species is very similar to and often confused with Haworthiopsis attenuata that has tubercles on both upper and lower surfaces of leaves. H. fasciata is rare in cultivation, and many H. attenuata specimens are mislabelled as H. fasciata. The specific epithet "fasciata" derives from the Latin "fascia," meaning "band or strip" and refers to the banded leaves.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Haworthia species like bright light, but not direct sunlight. In their native environment, they are often found in the shade of a rock or other object. They do best in a room with a window facing east or west to provide bright light for a few hours a day. White or yellow leaves usually signify too much sun. If the plant isn't getting enough light, its green color will fade. If you move your indoor Haworthia outdoors for the warmer months, avoid too much direct sunlight or it may get a sunburn.</p>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>Water evenly and generously in the summer, letting the soil media dry out between waterings. In the winter, reduce watering to every other month. Never allow water to collect in the rosette.</p>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>Haworthia species like warmer temperatures in the summer but cool in the winter (down to 50 degrees Fahrenheit). They can get a freezing injury at 40 degrees Fahrenheit. This plant doesn't need any humidity. What it does require is good ventilation, especially at night when they take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. You might use a fan to keep air circulating so your Haworthia can breathe.</p>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>Use a cactus mix or very fast-draining potting soil. Many growers warn that mixing potting soil with sand clogs up the pores so the soil doesn't drain as well, so sand should be avoided. Instead, mix with perlite, aquarium gravel, or pumice.</p>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Fertilize during the summer growing season with a cactus fertilizer. Don't feed during the winter.</p>
