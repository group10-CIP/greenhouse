		<h1>Indoor Plants Based on Your Personality</h1>
		<p class="author">by: John Christian Tiosan</p>

		<p>Everyone of us has their own unique personality. Some may be introverted, while others are extraverted; some always think logically, while others are more emotionally expressive; and some are practical, while others are imaginative and curious. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or MBTI is a popular way to classify ourselves to different categories. According to this, there are four roles each one of us belongs to. These are the analysts, diplomats, sentinels and explorers. These classifications determine our goals, interests and preferred activities. Just for fun, below are some house plants that we think will best suit your personalities based on these four roles.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Analysts</h2>
		<img src="../Media/ficus.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Analysts consist of architect (INTJ), logician (INTP), commander (ENTJ) and debater (ENTP). These people are known to be strategic thinkers. They are usually rational, impartial and intellectually excellent. </p>
		<p>For analyst people, Ficus reflects their personality the most. This plant symbolizes abundance and peace. Since some analysts are also known to be strong-willed leaders, it is a perfect fit as it is great for leaders to symbolize unity and success. Sometimes Ficus or fig trees also represents the Tree of Knowledge, which best suits analysts as they are great thinkers.  </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Diplomats</h2>
		<img src="../Media/peacelily.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Diplomats consist of advocate (INFJ), mediator (INFP), protagonist (ENFJ), campaigner (ENFP). They are known for their 	empathy, diplomatic skills and passionate idealism. These people are often cooperative and imaginative, which usually are the harmonizers in a group. Because of this, they are considered warm individuals. </p>
		<p>An indoor plant great for diplomats are peace lily. From its name, it symbolizes peace and harmony, perfect for diplomats who are the harmonizers in a group that manages conflicts that usually emerges during a group communication. Peace lily are also usually given to people recovering to illness – which is good way to show empathy to another person. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Sentinels</h2>
		<img src="../Media/crassula_ovata.png" class="featured">
		<p>Sentinels consist of logistician (ISTJ), defender (ISFJ), executive (ESTJ) and consul (ESFJ). They are known for their practicality and focus on order, security and stability. These people are hardworking, meticulous and usually sticks to rules and plans. </p>
		<p>Since they emphasize security and practicality, jade plant or sometimes called the money plant suits them best. It is because according to Chinese Feng Shui, it brings good luck, wealth, prosperity, and good fortune. It is also known for their longevity – perfect for sentinels who put attention to stability.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Explorers</h2>
		<img src="../Media/birdofparadise.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Explorers consist of virtuoso (ISTP), adventurer (ISFP), entrepreneur (ESTP) and entertainer (ESFP).  They are known for their spontaneity, ingenuity and flexibility. These people shine on situations that needs quick reaction and decision making. They are also good with different tools and are creative persons. </p>
		<p>Because of their mostly outgoing and vibrant personality, Strelitzia or Bird of Paradise will suit them best due to its bright and attention-grabbing appearance. Explorers are also adventurous which is perfect as Strelitzia resembles a bird in flight, free to explore the sky.</p>
