		<h1>AMAZON ELEPHANT'S EAR</h1>
		<img src="../Media/amazon.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Amazon elephant's ear is common but distinctive and almost regal. Large, arrow-shaped green leaves are ribbed with silver. They are much easier to grow inside than most Alocasia species and 
		provide seasonal displays of wonderful foliage. They prefer rich, fast-draining potting soil and do require regular feeding. This plant originated in southeast Asia. Hailing from Southeast Asia, 
		this popular elephant's ear (Alocasia x amazonica, part of the Alocasia genus) is sometimes called African mask. It's a hybrid that makes a striking and beautiful houseplant and is typically sold 
		as such. It is defined by its deep green leaves accentuated by whitish or light green veins. The leaves are roughly serrated, and in some cases, the leaf color appears as an almost purple-green. 
		Leaf shapes range from wide hearts to slim arrowheads, with textures from slick and glossy to thick and waxy. It is a fleshy evergreen that grows from underground corms. These plants rarely bloom, 
		however, and are grown primarily for their foliage. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>These plants require bright, indirect light. They can survive in 80-percent shade but prefer about 60-percent shade. Do not expose them to strong, direct sunlight.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>Keep the soil moist but remember that these plants do not like wet feet. If possible, water in the morning (so they are dry overnight) and from below, at the root zone, to keep the leaves from getting 
		too wet. This plant needs a rest period in winter when you should allow the soil to become almost dry between waterings, and stop fertilizing. If it dries completely it may go dormant, in which case you 
		may be able to dig up the corm and save it until you can keep it in warmer temperatures.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>Being a tropical plant, Amazon elephant's ear will go dormant or die if exposed to cold. It likes to be in a climate similar to its native Southeast Asia: a temperature between 65 and 75 F and above-average 
		humidity is ideal. You may need to raise the humidity levels in a room artificially by placing the plant in a humidity tray with pebbles or use a humidifier.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>This plant prefers a fast-draining, well-aerated potting soil. An organic, loose soil that contains a good amount of peat moss is ideal. If the soil is heavy, lighten it with some builder's sand or perlite.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Amazon elephant's ear tends to be a heavy feeder during its growing period and will respond well to applications of diluted balanced fertilizer. Starting in spring, feed the plant every two weeks. Stop the
		end of August, then start the cycle again at the beginning of the next spring. Occasionally, the leaves will yellow; if this happens, try adding fertilizer with micronutrients, or sprinkle Epsom salts around the 
		base of the plant once a month.</p>
