		<h1>ANTHURIUM</h1>
		<img src="../Media/anthurium.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Anthurium andraeanum is a tropical plant that is highly prized for its stately, bright flowers. Many anthurium cultivars are available, 
		and while they are challenging to grow, they are highly rewarding plants. Plant them in rich, loose potting soil and be sure the roots are 
		not too moist. If you are looking specifically for plants with pink flowers or leaves, consider adding a Mexican shrimp plant to your collection. 
		Anthurium is a genus of around 1,000 species of perennial plants native to Central America, northern South America, and the Caribbean. While they 
		can be grown outdoors in the garden in warm climates, anthurium is more often grown as houseplants by enthusiasts willing to put forth the effort 
		for a plant that can be fussy. Some species are highly prized for their bright, exotic flowers, while others are grown mostly for their foliage. 
		The flowering varieties of these plants are distinctive for their multicolored spathes and red or yellow tail-like flower spikes. Other varieties 
		feature large-leaved, deeply veined foliage. Many anthuriums are climbers and all need high humidity and warmth to thrive. They tend to thrive in 
		greenhouses, and no type of anthurium is particularly well-suited for indoor, domestic living without a lot of attention and care.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Indoors or out, anthuriums grow best in bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sun, which can burn the leaves.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>Anthuriums prefer a coarse, well-draining potting. An orchid mix with additional sand and peat moss mixed in, makes a perfect potting mix for anthuriums.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>The soil should be kept slightly moist and never allowed to dry out completely. Setting the pot in a tray of water-filled gravel will help the plant drain and also help keep humidity levels high. 
		Allow the top of the soil to dry out to the touch before watering again.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>All species of anthurium are native tropical plants and mimicking those conditions will give you the best chances for success. This plant prefers high humidity and temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. 
		These plants can be grown outside only in zones 11 to 12, and will likely perish at temperatures 40 degrees or less. <br>In dry climates—or during dry winter months—mist the plant daily to keep humidity levels high. 
		You may find it necessary to run a humidifier constantly during dry months.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>It is safe and recommended to use liquid fertilizer throughout the growing period. Use a fertilizer high in phosphorus, and dilute it to half strength to feed the plants every two weeks or so.</p>
