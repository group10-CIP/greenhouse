		<h1>FICUS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/ficus.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Ficus plants are fussy, but a well-grown ficus is near the pinnacle of houseplants. Large, glossy, and imposing, ficus plants are well worth the effort. Ficus plants drop their leaves in drafty, cold conditions, 
		and they don't like to be moved. In fact, they absolutely require adequate light, warmth, and humidity. Do not overwater. Watch for pests such as mites, mealybugs, whiteflies, and aphids. The enduringly popular 
		ficus plants belong to the fig genus. Although only a few are seen in cultivation, there are hundreds of species of ficus. They are native throughout the tropics, including Asia, America, and Africa. These serve 
		as decorative plants, food plants, and even religious symbols. Some types of ficus trees are also known as fig trees and produce the well-known fruit. The famous Bodhi tree under which Buddha achieved enlightenment 
		was a Ficus religiosa. In their native habitats, the ficus is often seen as a landscape tree with hanging and buttressed roots and a magnificent crown. In the home, the ficus is a beautiful specimen plant that can 
		provide many years of lush foliage. It is quite finicky, so be prepared for some specific care requirements.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Ficus plants need bright light, but only acclimated plants can handle the direct sun. They appreciate being moved outside in summer but do not place them in direct sunlight. Bright, direct light will scald the 
		leaves and cause leaf loss.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>Water the ficus evenly throughout the summer and reduce watering in the winter. In dry homes, provide plenty of ambient moisture by misting often. Do not let the root ball dry out and check the soil before watering.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>These plants cannot tolerate low temperatures or drafts. Maintain a temperature above 60 F at all times; they will do much better with temperatures above 70 F. Any cold drafts from windows, doors, or 
		air-conditioning units will cause harm. Keep them away from a drafty location. They like a relatively humid environment. Regularly mist the leaves or provide a pebble tray filled with water below the plant.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>A ficus needs well-draining, fertile soil. Soil-based potting mixes should work well for this plant and provide the nutrients it needs. Avoid using soils for roses or azaleas, since these are more acidic potting soils.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Feed your ficus with slow-release pellets at the beginning of the growing season. They are rapid growers and will benefit from monthly fertilization in the spring and summer and once every two months in the fall and winter.</p>
