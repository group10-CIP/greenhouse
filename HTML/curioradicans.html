		<h1>STRINGS OF BANANAS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/curio_radicans.png" class="featured">
		<p>Curio radicans, is a succulent houseplant that is native to South Africa. A member of the family Asteraceae, the asters, this species is closely related to the common string of pearls and Curio hallianus. It has multiple tendrils of glossy, banana-shaped foliage. It is commonly known as string of bananas.
        Like most members of the Curio genus, C. radicans is relatively hardy and easy to grow, making it a great starting point for novice gardeners and those seeking entry to the succulent or container gardening hobbies. An interesting addition to any home or garden, C. radicans is especially good for pots, hanging baskets, succulent gardens, and other areas in need of textural interest. Curio radicans is native to the Cape Province region of South Africa. In fact, in the desert areas of South Africa where aridity increases, including the Karroid central region, the dominant vegetation consists of xerophytic dwarf shrubs and succulents, including many members of the tribe Senecioneae. In these areas of very low moisture, the grasslands typical of other areas of Africa give way to areas in which grass is subdominant to these drought-tolerant plants, which are frequently spaced far apart with wide expanses of sandy or rocky stretches in between.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>These trailing succulents require bright, direct light when grown indoors. Choose a location that receives at least six hours of sunlight throughout the day. String of bananas do well under grow lights as well if needed. If this plant is not receiving enough light, it will become leggy and the banana-shaped leaves will become significantly more spaced out along the stem - a look that is often considered less visually appealing. </p>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>This hardy succulent is considered to be drought-tolerant with low water needs. There is no universal schedule for how often a string of bananas will need to be watered as this can depend on a variety of factors, but, as a general rule, the soil should be allowed to dry out completely between waterings.
		It is better to under-water a string of bananas than to overwater as they are highly susceptible to root rot. Keeping the succulent planted in well-draining soil and ensuring that the pot has adequate drainage will also help to prevent root rot. </p>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>While string of bananas are native to the dry and hot climates of South Africa, they do well in normal household temperatures and humidity levels. Ensure that your plant is kept away from heat/air conditioning vents as well as drafty or cold windows so it is not exposed to any extreme temperatures.</p>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>String of bananas requires a well-draining soil mix in order to help prevent root rot. You can purchase premixed cactus or succulent soil or mix your own at home. A simple mixture of 2 parts potting soil, 1 part perlite, and 1 part pumice or sand will provide your string of bananas with adequate drainage.</p>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>As with most succulents, string of bananas does not require regular fertilizing, although they can benefit from light feedings in the spring and summer months to help boost growth. Using organic fertilizers such as worm compost, liquid kelp, or fish emulsion is recommended.</p>
