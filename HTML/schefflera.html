		<h1>SCHEFFLERA</h1>
		<img src="../Media/schefflera.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Sometimes called the umbrella plant, Schefflera leaves are broad, glossy, and abundant. Use them as background plants or place a large one in a bright, warm corner for a nice canopy effect. Light, warmth, and humidity 
		are the keys to successfully growing Schefflera. Plant them in rich, loose potting media with moist compost, and fertilize twice a month. Schefflera is a genus of tropical plants including two species that make wonderful 
		tropical houseplants. The larger Schefflera actinophylla (sometimes called the umbrella plant or umbrella tree) features long, shiny, oval green leaves that droop gracefully from a central stalk, resembling an umbrella. 
		A mature Schefflera might have 12 to 16 leaflets from a single stalk, while an immature Schefflera is more likely to have four to six. Schefflera arboricola (sometimes called dwarf Schefflera) feature smaller, glossy leaves, 
		sometimes with creamy variegation. Other than the smaller size, it looks very similar to the taller cousin. Schefflera plants are hardy only to zone 10. In cooler climates, they're grown indoors for most of the years and
		can be taken outdoors for the warmer months. Indoors, they will thrive alongside other tropical plants. However, this plant is unlikely to bloom inside. They typically have to be grown outdoors to display their show of 
		long red, white, or pink tentacle-like flowers.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Schefflera prefers bright, indirect light. In the summer, move potted plants outside where they will receive bright light but not direct sun, such as under a patio cover. A Schefflera plant that gets leggy or floppy might 
		not be receiving enough light. Never place a Schefflera houseplant in direct, full sun because intense sun can burn the leaves.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>Water weekly during the growing season and spray the leaves frequently. You can wait until the soil in the pot dries out and then thoroughly soak the soil when you water. Cut back on water during winter. Often, people will 
		overwater a Schefflera plant and doing so will eventually kill it. Yellow and dropped leaves is a sign that you might be watering too much.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>Because it is a tropical plant, Schefflera requires fairly high humidity and tropical temperatures; it will suffer in temperatures lower than 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Do not expose these plants to drafts or dry heating vents. 
		An underwatered or cold Schefflera will begin to drop leaves quickly, so take leaf-drop seriously and correct the issue if it occurs. If the plant loses all if its leaves, you can attempt to save the plant by moving it outdoors 
		in the spring and watering generously.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>Plant Schefflera in a rich, loose potting media with moist compost. A well-draining sandy loam soil with a slightly acidic pH is ideal. Avoid planting in an outdoor location where the soil becomes too wet or waterlogged.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Feed Schefflera plants twice a week during the growing season with liquid fertilizer, or use two applications of slow-release pellets. They are heavy feeders and will benefit from the extra nutrients.</p>
