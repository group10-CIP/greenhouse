		<h1>TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Tropical and subtropical plants, in contrast with temperate plants, can be broadly defined as those meeting all of the following criteria: 
		crops that have their origin and commercial growing areas (when such exist) in the tropics or subtropics, plants that are evergreen and perennial, 
		crops with a limited degree of frost resistance, and plants whose growth is practically nonexistent below 50°F (10°C) (with some exceptions according 
		to species and individual age). A distinction between tropical and subtropical is possible if one considers that tropical species are not only sensitive 
		to temperatures below 68°F (20°C) but indeed require a climate with average mean temperatures higher than 50°F (10°C) for the coldest month (Watson and Moncur, 1985, p. 3). 
		Additionally most tropicals require humid environmental conditions. Strictly speaking, the tropics extend between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, at 23° north and south of the equator. 
		But, agronomically speaking, these boundaries are too rigid. Not only do they contain areas, especially at higher altitudes, that do not conform to the climatic 
		characteristics generally assigned to the tropics, but regions outside this belt have coastal areas or insular climates that may exhibit climatic conditions fitting 
		properly in the tropics. This is the reason why some climatologists have extended the region to the thirtieth parallels (Nakasone and Paull, 1998, p.1). In any event 
		the main feature associated with the tropics is not so much that of heat but rather steady warm temperatures throughout the year. J. A. Samson (1986, p. 1) gave a good 
		working definition of the tropical climate: temperature averages around 80.6°F (27°C), with the warmest month being only a few degrees higher than the coldest and 
		temperature differences between night and day, at any given time, being greater than those between winter and summer, and, finally, little variation in day length, 
		with the longest day being less than thirteen hours long. In comparison, the subtropics have hotter summers and cooler winters. Humidity is also generally lower. Day 
		length differences become greater with increased latitude. The limit for the subtropics is the isotherm of 50°F (10°C) average for the coldest month (Nakasone and Paull, 1998, p. 12).</p><br>
