		<h1>PANDA PLANT</h1>
		<img src="../Media/kalanchoe_tomentosa.png" class="featured">
		<p>Panda Plant or Kalanchoe tomentosa is a native to Madagascar species from the kalanchoe genus makes a nice addition to any succulent plant collection, grown indoors.
        The panda plant being a succulent type species grows thick leaves for water storage purposes, which means watering less often for the grower. These leaves are covered in tiny hairs that give the plant a velvety look and feel.
        The Kalanchoe tomentosa grows up to approximately 1.5 ft with a thick stem that produces branches and many groups of leaves, once it matures. When they're pruned well they have a kind of tree or bush look about them and can produce branches growing below pot level (now suitable for growing in a hanging basket).
        The furry leaves I mentioned are grayish green in color that have brown spotted tips. These leaves are mainly oval shaped, although your likely to see a few leaves randomly grow in whatever shape and form they want to.
        Although this plant can flower within it's natural habitat - it's rare to see flowers bloom indoors, so it's grown for primarily it's foliage within homes or offices. I have never seen one of these flower, but if your lucky enough then you will see lovely small tubular shaped flowers bloom at the tips of the branches.</p>

		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Panda plants appreciate bright, indirect light. Unlike other sun-loving succulent species, Kalanchoe tomentonsa does not do well in direct sun and is susceptible to leaf burn.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>Plant plants can be characterized as having low water needs. Allow the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings, especially in the winter months when the plant is dormant. Panda plants may require more frequent watering in the hot summer months. </p>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>No need to worry about humidity when it comes to panda plants - they enjoy dry conditions! The average household humidity is perfect for these succulents. 
		</p><br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>As with most succulents, panda plants require dry, well-draining soil. A cactus or succulent soil mix is sufficient for panda plants - and can be purchased at most garden centers and nurseries.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Regular fertilizing is not necessary for panda plants. However, fertilizing once at the beginning of the growing season (spring months) can help to encourage strong growth. A cactus or succulent fertilizer is best.</p>
