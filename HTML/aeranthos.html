		<h1>AERANTHOS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/aeranthos.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Tillandsia aeranthos is an epiphyte that tends to grow alone or in small clusters. The clusters can consist of two to up to a dozen plants. You can find them from sea level to hundreds meters in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil. Aeranthos flowers like clockwork every spring by producing a colorful inflorescence. It extends above the leaves and has rosy-purple floral bracts that are about 2.3-2.7 centimeters long from which about 5-20 small blue-violet flowers emerge with 3 petals that have edged tips. A small vase filled with rock or sand will allow the plant to stand out and will create a wonderful focal point to any room it lives in. Or group it together with several smaller air plants as the aeranthos can be a wonderful centerpiece with its bright and colorful bloom. Aeranthos plant is a slow-growing variety of air plant. It requires minimal care and maintenance.</p>
		
	<h2>Light</h2>
	<p>Filtered sunlight works best for the Tillandsia aeranthos bergeri. Too much intense, direct afternoon sun can cause the foliage to burn and turn brown. It's a fine balance, though, as not enough sun can mean growth is slow, and the plant might not bloom.</p>
		
	<h2>Water</h2>
	<p>Under and overwatering are common problems with Tillandsia species. Too little and the foliage can become dry, curled and brown. Too much and root rot can kill off the plant. If the leaves start to curl upwards excessively, this could be a sign the plant is dehydrated. Some enthusiasts recommended submerging the plant for around 12 hours to combat this problem.</p>	
	
	<h2>Temperature</h2>
	<p>The cold conditions can even stimulate better flowering. These plants usually don't have a problem surviving in temperatures as low as 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and can even cope with short periods of frost.</p>
		
	<h2>Soil</h2>
	<p>It can grow in very well-drained, leafy soils outdoors if the temperatures are right. However, they are more successfully and commonly grown as indoor air plants or kept in containers using a potting medium designed for Bromeliad species.</p>
		
	<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
	<p>Tillandsia aeranthos bergeri isn't always necessary, there are soluble fertilizers that have been developed especially for air plant species. Using them can encourage blooming. These solutions can be mixed into a water spray and applied a couple of times during the growing season. Be careful not to over-fertilize though, as this can scorch the plant.</p>
