		<h1>XEROS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/xeros.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Tillandsia xerographica, also can be called Xeros, is native air plant in the Mexico. They usually grow in the tallest branches of the trees in their natural habitat. High in the forest canopy, they grow entirely without soil, clinging to the trees. Their name is a bit of a mouthful - it understandably translates from Greek to mean “dry writing” or “dry painting.” These air plant has a beautiful silver leaves curl and spiral around themselves as they grow. This results in a striking and nearly spherical plant, which, thanks to its slow-growing habits, will leave you with stunning living decor that is easy to keep up with. The care for these plants is also similar to the other air plants, with just good air circulation and little moist.</p>
	<br>	
	<h2>Light</h2>
	<p>Filtered sunlight works best for the Tillandsia xerographica. Too much intense, direct afternoon sun can cause the foliage to burn and turn brown. It's a fine balance, though, as not enough sun can mean growth is slow, and the plant might not bloom.</p>
	
	<br>	
	<h2>Water</h2>
	<p>Under and overwatering are common problems with Tillandsia species. Too little and the foliage can become dry, curled and brown. Too much and root rot can kill off the plant. If the leaves start to curl upwards excessively, this could be a sign the plant is dehydrated. Some enthusiasts recommended submerging the plant for around 12 hours to combat this problem. Mist the plant for 2 or 4 times a week.</p>	
	
	<br>
	<h2>Temperature</h2>
	<p>The cold conditions can even stimulate better flowering. These plants usually don't have a problem surviving in temperatures as low as 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and can even cope with short periods of frost. It can withstand near freezing temperatures, but most will thrive between 70 F and 85 F. High humidity is a bonus.</p>

	<br>	
	<h2>Soil</h2>
	<p>It can grow in very well-drained, leafy soils outdoors if the temperatures are right. However, they are more successfully and commonly grown as indoor air plants or kept in containers using a potting medium designed for Bromeliad species. Or they can be on driftwoods, cork, or corals stones.</p>
	
	<br>	
	<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
	<p>Tillandsia xerographica isn't always necessary, there are soluble fertilizers that have been developed especially for air plant species. Using them can encourage blooming. These solutions can be mixed into a water spray and applied a couple of times during the growing season. Be careful not to over-fertilize though, as this can scorch the plant.</p>
