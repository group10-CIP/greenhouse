		<h1>CROWN OF THORNS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/euphorbia_milii.png" class="featured">
		<p>Euphorbia milii or Crown of Thorns, is a deciduous, herbaceous, perennial shrub with bright green leaves and greenish flowers. The flowers are enclosed within long-lasting and bright bracts of red or yellow. The plant is loose in form, spiny and irregularly shaped, with thick, black thorns and its historic presence in the Middle East led to the belief by some that the stems of this plant had been used in Christ's crown of thorns, hence the common name. In its country of origin (Madagascar) the plant will grow to 5 or 6 feet tall; however, in the United States, it typically grows to 3 feet, or 2 feet when grown as a houseplant.Euphorbia milii grows best in dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Because it does not like wet, cold soils or temperatures below 35 degrees F. It is an easy to grow indoor plant where it prefers a sunny location in soil-based potting mix. If grown outside in hot summer climates, provide the plant with midday shade and moderate moisture for better flower bloom. You can propagate the plant from tip cuttings; however, because the resulting white latex sap causes a mild poisonous reaction when in contact with skin or eyes, wear gloves when working with this plant.
        Sticky, showy, paired-bract flowers on gray stems with long spines identify this plant. Cyclical leaf drop is normal, but messy and preceeds the plant's resting season (usually winter). The long spines are dangerous to inattentive gardeners, children and pets. The plant is often used as a specimen plant for interiors with high light or as annual outdoor plant. 
        Crown of Thorns prefers bright light, dry soil and low relative humidity. You can propagate the plant from cuttings, but let sap dry before placing the cutting in a growing medium.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>As with most flowering plants, the better the sun exposure, the more blooms you will get. However, crown of thorns will reliably bloom as long as it gets at least 3 - 4 hours of bright, direct sunlight per day. Outdoors, aim for a spot full sun. Indoors, place your plant in a west or south-facing winter during winter.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>Since it is a succulent, crown of thorns is very forgiving about water. Water when the soil feels dry about 1 inch below the surface. Water thoroughly and allow any excess to drain off. Do not let your plant sit in water or wet soil for prolonged periods of time or the roots will rot.</p>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>At least half a day of sunlight is its other major requirement. Temperature-wise, a comfortable 65-75 F. (18-24 C.) degrees F. is good. Donâ€™t worry if you lower the thermostat at night, Crown of thorns can handle temperatures down to 50 F.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>Use a sandy, well-drained soil that is 2/3 cactus or succulent Learn the definition of a succulent plant and why they are called a "fat plant." potting soil and 1/3 perlite or coarse sand. The soil should drain quickly to prevent root-rot. A Crown of Thorns plant needs re-potting about every two or three years.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Fertilize the Crown of Thorns with a full-strength, liquid fertilizer when you plant. After that, dilute the fertilizer to half-strength and apply once a month during the spring, summer, and fall.</p>
