		<h1>PEACE LILY</h1>
		<img src="../Media/peacelily.jpg" class="featured">
		<p>Peace lilies are lovely, especially when massed and in bloom. This plant is easy to grow and maintain, and the blooms last for months. Even if they are a bit of a challenge to overwinter, it is still well worth 
		the effort. Avoid direct sunlight and keep the temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Peace lilies are tropical species and hybrid from the Spathiphyllum genus that are favorite flowering houseplants. A striking 
		plant when used in mass display, the peace lily blooms in spring with long-lasting flower stalks that hover gracefully over the foliage. The plant has glossy oval leaves with points that emerge from the soil. A 
		well-grown peace lily may bloom twice a year, resulting in several months of flowers. Peace lilies are indisputably terrific as houseplants. Small varieties look attractive on a tabletop and bigger ones can occupy 
		a nice-sized spot on the floor. They filter more indoor pollutants than most other plants, so are great for bedrooms or other frequented rooms. Inside the tropical plant's pores, toxic gases like carbon monoxide 
		and formaldehyde are broken down and neutralized. Peace lily can also be grown outdoors in warm climates, where it can tower as much as 6 feet high.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>Peace lilies are shade-loving plants in their native habitats, but when grown indoors they need plenty of filtered light, though not direct sunlight. Some varieties can withstand more light than others. Curled, 
		pale leaves generally indicate that the plant is receiving too much light and scorched leaves indicate too much direct sun. In either case, the plant should be moved to a shadier location.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>During the summer, water and mist peace lilies frequently because they thrive with higher humidity, such as that found in the rainforest. In winter, reduce watering but never allow the soil to dry out. If your 
		water is highly chlorinated, use filtered water. Or, you can allow tap water to sit for several days until the chlorine evaporates out.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>These plants really prefer moist warmth. Avoid cold drafts and temperatures below 55 degrees Fahrenheit, because the plant will die in cold temperatures. The ideal temperature range is 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. 
		Spritz the leaves every week with softened or distilled water throughout the summer growing season.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>Peace lilies like a rich, loose potting soil containing plenty of organic material. These plants are native to tropical canopy conditions where the soil is rich with deteriorating plant material. Growing them as 
		outdoor garden plants requires soil that mimics this composition.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>Feed weekly in the summer or use slow-release pellets at the beginning of the season. Do not fertilize in the winter.</p>
