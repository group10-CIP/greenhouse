		<h1>PENCIL CACTUS</h1>
		<img src="../Media/euphorbia_tirucalli.png" class="featured">
		<p>Pencil Cactus or Euphorbia tirucalli, is a succulent, spineless shrub or tree with a heavy trunk, brown primary branches, and pencil-like, green, new branches. Leaves cluster at the tip of the branches, as do insignificant flowers within showy bracts. It is tropical to semi-tropical by nature and reliably winter hardy to USDA Zone 11. It is currently surviving in southern parts of Florida and California in Zone 10. It is drought tolerant and when grown outdoors in warm climates, the tree can reach heights of 30 feet and is typically used as a hedge or barrier. When grown in more temperate climates, it can be kept smaller and used as a houseplant. When grown outdoors, the plant does best in dry climates where the temperature ranges from 50 degrees in the evening and 75 degrees during the day. Plant in well-drained soils that are nourishing but without high organic content and water only when the soil is dry. If local conditions include host summers, it is best to site the plant where there is some afternoon shade. When grown indoors, use coarse loams with peat moss or leaf mold plus gritty material such as coarse sand.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Light</h2>
		<p>The pencil cactus prefers to grow in full sun, meaning at least six hours of sunlight on most days. However, it can tolerate a bit of shade and might even appreciate some protection from hot afternoon sun. Indoors, grow it by your brightest window.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>The watering care for this succulent is very easy. It only needs water every two to three weeks in the spring and summer. Reduce watering to monthly in the fall and winter. It's preferable to let the soil dry out completely in between waterings to avoid overwatering. This plant is highly tolerant to drought, and too much water can rot its roots.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Temperature and Humidity</h2>
		<p>The pencil cactus thrives in warm temperatures ranging from 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures around the plant should not drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoors, be sure to protect your plant from cool drafts, including those from an air conditioner. The plant also thrives in low humidity. But a higher humidity level shouldn’t bother it as long as the soil doesn’t retain moisture. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Soil</h2>
		<p>This plant loves dry, sandy soil that isn’t highly rich in nutrients. Container plants do well with a succulent or cactus potting mix that doesn’t retain moisture. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
		<p>This plant isn’t a heavy feeder. Feed your pencil cactus with a balanced liquid houseplant fertilizer in the spring, and it should be fine for the rest of the year.</p>
